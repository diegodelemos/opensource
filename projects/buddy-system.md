# Buddy system

## Goal
The goal of the buddy system is multifaceted:

* Ensure newcomers feel comfortable and part of our team
* Speed up the process of gaining essential technical knowledge for working on Invenio
* Develop buddies skills in communication and take larger responsibility in the project

## Who is involved?
As previously mentioned, the buddy system intends to improve newcomers' experience, but for doing so there are four main actors who have to take part:

* The newcomer
* Buddy
* Newcomer's supervisor
* Buddy system maintainer

## Who is the Buddy?
* A person assigned to a newcomer for the first two months to help in both technical and social aspects

* Someone from another service team to ensure cross-team integration inside the section

* Can not be the newcomer’s supervisor

* The section leader is responsible of selecting the newcomer's buddy

* Should be available during the first two weeks after the newcomer arrives, and should not have extended absences (i.e. >2-3 weeks) during the first two months

* For absences of a week or more, the buddy should ensure to hand-over buddy responsibilities to a colleague

## What are the responsibilities?

In general buddy's responsibilities are:

1. Being cool with her/his newcomer :sunglasses:
2. Being available for her/him
3. Make sure that she/he doesn't miss section official/social events because of lack of information
4. Arrange informal meetings with her/him as often as needed
5. Follow-up with the buddy system maintainer
6. Turn to the buddy system maintainer any time if needed

Besides, since the process will span over a period of two months, a more specific list divided by phases will be provided.

### Before newcomers arrival
The buddy must meet the newcomer’s supervisor in order to get an overview of her/his project and discuss the first tasks:

* Schedule when supervisor will introduce buddy to the newcomer
* Define tasks on Invenio
  * One of the following small tasks: read up relevant Invenio documentation, rehearse the presentations, test tutorials, check if any part of the material is outdated (~1 hr)
  * A medium sized task (~1 day) suitable for pair-programming
  * A first larger service task in which the supervisor will help
* Agree on who is going to run the bootcamp following `inveniosoftware/training` repository.

### During the two months
The process described below is a general framework, but it is up to the buddy to assess, with the help of the newcomer, the need of each action i.e. if the newcomer is familiar with some technology or she/he feels like she/he can do some of the task by himslef there is no need to make a direct supervision.

**Remember**, let the newcomer know that she/he can come back whenever she/he finds a blocker and be ready for when it happens.

#### 1st week

* Run the bootcamp with the newcomer (using standard material/presentations) (if agreed with supervisor):
  * Presentation: Introduction to Invenio, use-cases and digital repositories
  * Presentation: Communication channels (Gitter, Mattermost etc...) Maintainers, Meetings
* Guided tutorial: Setting up your development environment
* Guided tutorial: Get Invenio up and running
* Guided tutorial: Developing for Invenio, including cookiecutter (+seeing all the files), tiny task, running tests, installing inside Invenio
* Pair-programming: Solve first small task
* Tutorial: Submitting a pull request
* Presentation: Overview of contribution and style guide
* Pair-programming: Solve medium sized task
* Presentation: Invenio general architecture overview
* Presentation: Module overview
* Plan for pair-programming on a service task

**Remember**, newcomers also need “free” time for setting up their environment, office space etc ...

#### 2nd week

* Pair-programming on service task

#### 3rd-8th week

* Newcomer should already feel comfortable enough to ask for help whenever needed
* Be accessible for newcomer
* Check that pull requests and interaction with the section is appropriate (i.e. according to CERN and Invenio code of conduct)
* Proactively ask for feedback

#### 8th week

* Final feedback meeting with buddy (always take note about how to improve the system)
* Retrospective meeting about last two months with buddy system maintainer

## What happens next

Of course after the two months the 'official assistance' is over but, it doesn't finish here, you will still be in contact with the not that newcomer anymore and she/he can still ask questions or even help you back!
